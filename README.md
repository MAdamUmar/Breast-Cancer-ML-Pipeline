# Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset. This project features complete data preprocessing, feature selection, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and detailed performance evaluation through visuals.

Achieved a final accuracy score of 97% and a final F1 score of 0.965.
